        <p>After I graduated college, I moved to Louisville, KY, and started
         my career as a writer for national fitness magazines. I was fired
          for “not being happy,” this led me to lose my apartment and my 
          sense of self, and I slipped into a terrible depression. 
          I started designing resumes out of coffee shops to afford gas,
           and that’s when I realized my deep love to design. I became 
           obsessed with learning everything I could about design and would 
           spend hours every night creating whatever I could. </p>

        Having a website you love allows you to show up for your business the way it deserves.We both know you’re great at what you do, but without a site you’re excited to show off, you’re not allowing yourself to be fully seen.
